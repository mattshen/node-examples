The test data for the Large Text Compression Benchmark is the first 109 bytes of the English Wikipedia dump on Mar. 3, 2006. http://download.wikipedia.org/enwiki/20060303/enwiki-20060303-pages-articles.xml.bz2 (1.1 GB or 4.8 GB after decompressing with bzip2 - link no longer works). Results are also given for the first 108 bytes, which is also used for the Hutter Prize. These files have the following sizes and checksums:

Download in PPMd var. J format (requires 256 MB free memory): enwik8.pmd (21,388,296 bytes) enwik9.pmd (183,964,915 bytes).

Download in zip format: enwik8.zip (36,445,475 bytes) enwik9.zip (322,592,222 bytes).

The data is UTF-8 encoded XML consisting primarily of English text. enwik9 contains 243,426 article titles, of which 85,560 are #REDIRECT to fix broken links, and the rest are regular articles. The example fragment below shows a redirection of "AdA" to "Ada programming language" and the start of a regular article with title "Anarchism".

The data is UTF-8 clean. All characters are in the range U'0000 to U'10FFFF with valid encodings of 1 to 4 bytes. The byte values 0xC0, 0xC1, and 0xF5-0xFF never occur. Also, in the Wikipedia dumps, there are no control characters in the range 0x00-0x1F except for 0x09 (tab) and 0x0A (linefeed). Linebreaks occur only on paragraph boundaries, so they always have a semantic purpose. In the example below, lines were broken at 80 characters, but in reality each paragraph is one long line.

The data contains some URL encoded XHTML tags such as &lt;ref&gt ... &lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;br /&gt; which decode to <ref> ... </ref> (citation) and <br /> (line break). However, hypertext links have their own encoding. External links are enclosed in square brackets in the form [URL anchor text]. Internal links are encoded as [[Wikipedia title | anchor text]], omitting the title and vertical bar if the title and anchor text are identical. Non-English characters are sometimes URL encoded as &amp;#945;, meaning &#945; (Greek alpha, α), but are more often coded directly as a UTF-8 byte sequence.

'''Anarchism''' originated as a term of abuse first used against early [[working
 class]] [[radical]]s including the [[Diggers]] of the [[English Revolution]] an
d the [[sans-culotte|''sans-culottes'']] of the [[French Revolution]].[http://uk
.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html] Whilst the term is still
 used in a pejorative way to describe ''&quot;any act that used violent means to
 destroy the organization of society&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/so
cy/faculty/deflem/zhistorintpolency.html History of International Police Coopera
tion], from the final protocols of the &quot;International Conference of Rome fo
r the Social Defense Against Anarchists&quot;, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;, it has also bee
n taken up as a positive label by self-defined anarchists.

The word '''anarchism''' is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Greek language|Gree
k]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&

The graph below shows the incremental compressed size of enwik9 over a sliding window of about 2-4 MB when compressed with ppmd var. J with options -o10 -m256 -r1 (maximum compression as in the main table). The horizontal axis is the position in the file, from 0 to 1 GB. The vertical axis is the compression ratio on a scale of 0 to 0.3. The graph was produced by modifying the source code for ppmd to print the graph coordinates, then smoothing the data for display.

Incremental compression ratio of enwik9 with ppmd var. J set for maximum compression.

The dip in the middle of the graph is due to a large group of articles on towns in the US written in a similar style that appear to be generated automatically from a table of census data. A sample of titles from this region appears below. Unrelated articles are occasionally mixed in.

    Springboro, Pennsylvania
    Steuben Township, Pennsylvania
    Summerhill Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania
    Summit Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania
    Titusville, Pennsylvania
    Townville, Pennsylvania
    Troy Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania

String repetition statistics

The following diagrams show the distribution of string matches of length 1 (black), 2 (red), 4 (green), and 8 (blue). The horizontal axis represents the position in the file. The vertical axis shows the distance backwards to the previous match on a logarithmic scale. The major tick marks reading upwards are 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.

enwik8

enwik8 is fairly uniform. The blue band at the top shows that matches of length 8 are most often separated by at least 105 bytes (5 major tick marks) up to the entire length of the file. The green band shows that matches of length 4 are most commonly separated by 103 to 104 bytes. The red band shows that matches of length 2 are separated by about 10 to 300 bytes. The gray band shows that single byte matches are usually separated by 1 or by 3 to about 10. The light gray band shows an absence of matches separated by 2, such as "aba".

enwik9

The highly compressible region in the center of enwik9 is clearly visible. The dark blue-green band shows that there are frequent matches of length 4-8 separated by about 3000 bytes, the length of one article. The articles are fairly uniform in length, but not exactly so. The dark red bands below it show a separation of around 20-80 bytes, typical of tables.

The blue region extends all the way to the top of the image, showing redundancy across the entire file. Thus, a compressor would benefit by using lots of memory. Breaking the file into smaller, separately compressed pieces would hurt compression.

enwik6

This shows the first 106 bytes of data, essentially zooming into the first 1% of enwik8 or first 0.1% of enwik9. The clear, vertical bands show regions consisting primarily of XML to encode #REDIRECTs. These have a regular, repeating structure of length 300-400 bytes. The white vertical bands extending upwards show that there are no long distance matches backwards (they occur closer). The upward curving white bands show the absence of long distance forward matches.

These images were generated with the FV program. Download: fv.cpp (7KB, GPL, C++), fv.exe (25KB, 32-bit Windows). The program uses 512 MB memory. It took about 14 minutes to generate the image for enwik9 on a 2.2 GHz Athlon-64 under WinXP Home. The program outputs in .bmp format. You will need another program to convert to .jpg, .png, etc.

For comparison, the Calgary corpus (concatenated) is shown below. The image was hand edited to add the labels. The repetitive structure of book1 (70-80), geo (4), obj2 (4), and pic (216) is clearly visible. The image also shows that there is redundancy between text files but not the binary files. (More FV results by Leonardo Maffi).

Lexical Analysis

The table below shows the frequency distribution for the 100 most common words in enwik9, as well as selected ranks of lower frequency. The file was parsed by considering all sequences of English letters (A-Z, a-z) as single words, and all other single characters as words. The most common token is the space, which occurs 139 million times. ^J is the linefeed character. Upper and lower case are considered distinct.

Note that the data deviates from a Zipf distribution (rank x frequency = constant). The vocabulary is 1,418,809 words. An order 0 model based on this distribution would have a compressed size of 400,889,188 bytes. In addition, an order 0 character encoding of the dictionary would require 7,044,509 bytes for a total of 407,933,697. This does not include a small amount of additional space that would be needed to encode the word frequencies, lengths of the dictionary and compressed data. For comparison, some other order 0 compressed sizes are given below for various parsing methods compared to this baseline parsing method.

In the 1-gram through 5-gram models, the text is divided into uniform blocks of 1 to 5 bytes. The 5-gram model compresses almost as well as the word model but the dictionary is almost 4 times as large.

Slight compression occurs when words that occur only once are spelled with 2, 3, or 4-grams rather than added to the dictionary. Spelling such words with letters results in a slight expansion.

Spelling words that occur once or twice does not compress as well as spelling words that occur only once. (That might not be true for higher order models).

In space modeling, words are assumed to be preceded by a space in certain contexts, and the space is removed from the encoded text. If a space is predicted but none occurs, then a special symbol is added to encode this fact. This results in an increase of 1 to the vocabulary size (compared to baseline, no words are spelled). A 7.5% improvement in compression over baseline was obtained by assuming that a space occurs before the word after any upper or lower case letter, or the characters "." (period), "," (comma), "]" (closing bracket), "}" (closing brace), or ")" (closing parenthesis). There are 2,196,539 no-space symbols in enwik9, making it the 33rd most frequent.

Stemming consists of replacing an inflected form of a word with its base form (stem) plus a symbol indicating the suffix. This was accomplished with a low error rate by trying a set of stemming rules on each incoming word and testing if the resulting stem occurs frequently enough in the baseline dictionary (collected in an earlier pass). Each word is tested to see whether it ends in one of the suffixes in the stemming table, and if so, the suffix is replaced and the frequency of the resulting word is tested from the baseline dictionary. If the stem occurs at least 1/16 as often and is at least 3 characters long, then the word is coded as a stem plus a suffix code. If more than one rule could apply, then the rule that produces the highest frequency stem is used.

The stemming table is below, sorted by "Freq", the number of times each rule was applied in enwik9.

For example, the words "rotates", "rotated", "rotation", and "rotating" would all stem to "rotate". One problem is that the baseline dictionary is case sensitive, so that "Rotates" is stemmed only if "Rotate" occurs. There are occasional errors such as stemming "coming" to "com" + "ing" and "refer" to "ref" + "er". This happens because "com" is more common then "come" (in links) and "ref" occurs as an XHTML tag to encode references. The minimum stem length of 3 prevents "as" from being stemmed as the plural of "a" and similar errors.

Stemming makes order 0 compression worse due to the additional suffix tokens, but it reduces the dictionary size and might help in a model that uses syntactic or semantic modeling.

The simplest form of capital encoding is to replace each upper case letter with a special symbol followed by the lower case equivalent. This hurts compression over baseline but reduces the dictionary size and helps in some higher order models. enwik9 contains 41,507,612, making this the second most common symbol after space.

Some words such as proper nouns are always capitalized, so it is wasteful to use capital encoding. An improvement is to build a baseline dictionary and test whether the version with the first letter capitalized or lower case is more frequent (e.g. "Pat" or "pat"), and store that version in the dictionary. The less common form is encoded by preceding it with a special symbol to indicate the case of the first letter should be changed. This results in a larger dictionary but better compression than simple capital encoding. There are 15,065,442 change-case symbols in enwik9, making it the fourth most common symbol after space, [, and ].
Relationship of Wikipedia Text to Clean Text
(June 11, 2006) Abstract: The entropy of "clean" written English, in a 27 character alphabet containing only the letters a-z and nonconsecutive spaces, has been estimated to be between 0.6 and 1.3 bits per character [3,8]. We find that most of the best compressors will compress Wikipedia text (enwik9, 1 GB) and equivalent cleaned text (fil9, 715 MB) to about the same ratio, usually within 3% of each other. Low end compressors will compress clean text about 5% smaller. Furthermore, a quick test on 100 MB of cleaned text (text8) will predict a compression ratio that is about 2% to 4% below the true ratio on fil9 for most compressors.
Introduction

Most data compression benchmarks, including the large text benchmark (enwik9), use data sets with unknown algorithmic complexity. For most benchmarks, this is not important because their purpose is to compare data compression algorithms to one another. However, this benchmark has the goal of encouraging research in natural language models, so we also wish to compare algorithms to human models. Shannon [3] and Cover and King [8] estimated the entropy of written English to be between 0.6 and 1.3 bits per character, based on the ability of humans to predict consecutive characters from a 27 character alphabet containing only the monocase letters a-z and nonconsecutive spaces. However, enwik9 is not in this form; it contains capitalization, punctuation, foreign text, tables, markup, formatting, hypertext links, and XML structure such as timestamps, authorship, and comments. In this paper we estimate the effects of these artifacts on compression ratio for 25 programs.
Experimental Procedure

We filter the 1 GB test file enwik9 to produce a 715 MB file fil9, and compress this with 17 compressors. Furthermore, we produce the file text8 by truncating fil9 to 100 MB, and test this on 25 compressors, including the 17 tested on fil9. The purpose of the smaller file is to allow quicker testing, and to establish the predictive value of this quick test on the larger data set.

The clean version of the Wikipedia was prepared with the goal of retaining only text that normally would be visible when displayed on a Wikipedia web page and read by a human. Only regular article text was retained. Image captions were retained, but tables and links to foreign language versions were removed. Citations, footnotes, and markup were removed. Hypertext links were converted to ordinary text, retaining only the (visible) anchor text. Numbers were spelled out ("20" becomes "two zero", a common practice in speech research). Upper case letters were converted to lower case. Finally, all sequences of characters not in the range a-z were converted to a single space. The effect of this filtering on enwik8 is to reduce the text to about 70% of its original size before spelling digits, then expand it to about 74%. The detailed effect of each step is shown in the table below for enwik8 (which would result in the first 74 MB of fil9 or text8. The effects of individual steps was not tested on enwik9, but the final result is a little smaller (71.5%)

Experimental Results

Compressed sizes of text8 and fil9 are given in the table below. For each compressor, the options are selected as in the main table (as of June 10, 2006), which were tuned for maximum compression on enwik9. (Note this may bias the results toward raw text). The column t8/e8 is the ratio of the compressed size of text8 to the compressed size of enwik8. It shows that the clean text usually compresses smaller by a few percent. The enwik8 results are from the main table, as is the algorithm and memory used (in MB). Decompression was not verified. Speed was not measured.

The fil9 results are shown as both the compressed size and compression ratio, since the uncompressed size is odd. The column f9/e9 is the compression ratio of fil9 divided by the compression ratio for enwik9, not including the size of the decompressor in either case. (The decompressor size has a very small effect). The compression ratio for enwik9 is from the main table. The error, t8/e8 - f9/e9 is the amount by which a test on text8 would underestimate the compressed size of fil9, usually about 2% to 4%.

The results show that high end compressors have about the same compression ratio on clean text as on raw text, while faster compressors will compress clean text about 5% smaller. Using text8 as a fast test to predict the effect of cleaning enwik9 tends to underestimate the compressed size of clean text by about 2% to 3% on faster compressors and by about 4% on high end compressors.

Alexandru Mosoi has produced some preprocessing tools to improve compression of fil9, discussed here, and has produced the graph below which shows the vocabulary size vs. word token count of fil9. The graph is consistent with a Zipf distribution: the n'th most frequent word has frequency proportional to 1/n [20].

Cumulative dictionary size vs. word count of fil9 (by Alexandru Mosoi).

New words added to dictionary (per 217 word block) vs. word count of fil9. This is essentially the derivative of the above graph (by Alexandru Mosoi).

This Perl program filters Wikipedia text dumps to produce 27 character text (lowercase letters and spaces) as described in this article. To use:

  perl wikifil.pl enwik9 > text

Then truncate the text to the desired length (e.g. 108 bytes).

You can cut and paste the program below. (Note it contains URL encoding to display properly).

# letters (a-z, converted from A-Z), and spaces (never consecutive).  
# All other characters are converted to spaces.  Only text which normally appears
